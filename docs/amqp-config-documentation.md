# RabbitMQ Configuration

The following is an index of practical configuration and administrative tasks for RabbitMQ.  We attempt to tackle a number of issues people may have with RabbitMQ with custom software or clever software admin tricks.  We also extend the existing RabbitMQ documentation by walking readers through a complete configuration, ending with a RabbitMQ Cluster that is  load-balanced, firewalled, SSL-enabled, secure-Management Console'd, etc.  Basically, what you would want in a if you had to deliver a messaging solution in a hostile environment.

We recommend reading the documentation in the following order.

1.  Installing RabbitMQ on CentOS 6.3 Minimal
2.  Enabling RabbitMQ Management Console
3.  Configuring *iptables* for a single instance of RabbitMQ
4.  Configuring *iptables* for a RabbitMQ Cluster
5.  Clustering RabbitMQ
6.  Verify the Cluster's Status
7.  Configuring SSL for RabbitMQ
8.  Securing the RabbitMQ Management Console with SSL
